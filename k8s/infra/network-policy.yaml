# When cert manager creates a certificate in retail-store-ns and http01 solver pod created by cert-manager to verify the domain, it needs to access the internet to validate the domain. So, we created this policy, to allow the temporarily created http01 solver pod by cert-manager to verify the domain, to access the internet
